    "\n",
    "We are doing our analysis on [Spotify Multi-Genre Playlist Data](https://www.kaggle.com/siropo/spotify-multigenre-playlists-data).\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of song features taken from Spotify and separated into six broad genres of music. \n",
    "Our analysis aims to answer to solve two problems:\n",
    "1. How do you predict the genre of a song based on its features\n",
    "2. What song features are more influential to a particular genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a random sampling of songs on Spotify: each song was on a playlist made by the person who collected the dataset. \n",
    "However, there is still a wide variety of genres it will work for purposes of our analysis. \n",
    " \n",
    "The dataset has the following 22 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artist Name\n",
    "2. Song Name\n",
    "3. Popularity: value from 1 to 100 that represents the song's popularity (magically determined by Spotify)\n",
    "4. Genres: a detailed list of the genres for each artist\n",
    "5. Playlist: the name of the playlist each song came from\n",
    "6. Danceability\n",
    "7. Energy\n",
    "8. Key\n",
    "9. Loudness\n",
    "9. Mode\n",
    "10. Speechiness\n",
    "11. Acousticness\n",
    "12. Instrumentalness\n",
    "13. Liveness\n",
    "14. Valence\n",
    "15. Tempo\n",
    "16. ID\n",
    "17. URI\n",
    "18. HRef\n",
    "19. Analysis_url\n",
    "19. Duration_Ms\n",

    "## Loading the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is broken into 6 files, with each file containing the songs from a single genre of music. \n",
    "Here, we load the files into memory and combine them into one dataset. \n",
    "We also drop the playlist, ID, URI, HRef, and Analysis_url columns because they are not relevant for our analysis. \n",
    "Since we will be combining all of the songs into a single dataset, we also have to add another column containing the genre of each song. "
