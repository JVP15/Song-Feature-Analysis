    "We are doing our analysis on [Spotify Multi-Genre Playlist Data](https://www.kaggle.com/siropo/spotify-multigenre-playlists-data).\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of song features taken from Spotify and separated into six broad genres of music. \n",
    "Our analysis aims to answer to solve two problems:\n",
    "1. How do you predict the genre of a song based on its features\n",
    "2. What song features are more influential to a particular genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a random sampling of songs on Spotify: each song was on a playlist made by the person who collected the dataset. \n",
    "However, there is still a wide variety of genres it will work for purposes of our analysis. \n",
    " \n",
    "The dataset has the following 22 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artist Name\n",
    "2. Song Name\n",
    "3. Popularity: value from 1 to 100 that represents the song's popularity (magically determined by Spotify)\n",
    "4. Genres: a detailed list of the genres for each artist\n",
    "5. Playlist: the name of the playlist each song came from\n",
    "6. Danceability\n",
    "7. Energy\n",
    "8. Key\n",
    "9. Loudness\n",
    "9. Mode\n",

    "We also drop the playlist, ID, URI, HRef, and Analysis_url columns because they are not relevant for our analysis. \n",
    "Since we will be combining all of the songs into a single dataset, we also have to add another column containing the genre of each song. "
